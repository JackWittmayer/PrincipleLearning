            "content: Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, articles, and other sources. These models learn to understand and generate human-like language by identifying patterns in how words and sentences are used. Using deep learning techniques—particularly transformer architectures—LLMs can perform a wide range of tasks, such as answering questions, writing stories, coding, summarizing text, and translating languages. Their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses makes them powerful tools in natural language processing. Examples include models like GPT-3, BERT, and Llama. While highly capable, they still require careful use to avoid inaccuracies, biases, or misinformation.\n"
